About Me

I am a software tester with a strong focus on product quality, risk analysis, and test strategy. I work across the software development lifecycle to validate functionality, stability, and user experience through structured and exploratory testing.

My expertise includes test case design, requirement analysis, defect tracking, regression testing, and release validation in Agile environments. I collaborate closely with developers, product managers, and stakeholders to identify issues early, improve test coverage, and support reliable deployments.

I approach testing with a quality-engineering mindset, combining attention to detail with a deep understanding of system behavior, APIs, and real-world user scenarios. My goal is to prevent defects, optimize testing processes, and ensure software performs as expected in production.
